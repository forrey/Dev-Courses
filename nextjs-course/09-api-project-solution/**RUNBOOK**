This app displays a list of events which come from the dummy-data.js file
It also connects to a MongoDB cluster and saves:

- email addresses from a newsletter registration
- comments for each event

The API routes are found in:

- pages -> api
  One is standard and only accepts POST (for newsletter emails)
  The other is dynamic (for events) and accepts POST and GET

Connection to MongoDB is done through helper functions in helpers -> db-util.js

Key components to look at are:

- components -> input -> newletter-registration, where we send data to the newsletter api route

- components -> input -> comments.js. This is the start of our comments flow, and it sends data
