This is all about application-wide state.
The purpose of this project was to show notifications in the following situations:

- When submitting an email to newsletter registration, show pending and then success notification
- When submitting a comment, show pending then success
- Show loading when loading comments

Key files here are:

- noticiation-context.js
- notification.js
- \_app.js
- layout.js
- comments.js
- newsletter-registration.js

We start by writing our notification-context.js file, which will create the context that the app will use.

Then we go to \_app.js, and wrap the whole content in our context provider

Then we go to layout and add the notification component itself

Then we trigger the actual notification in newsletter-registration.js and comments.js
