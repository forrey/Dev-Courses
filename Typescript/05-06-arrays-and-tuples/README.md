# Annotations with Functions and Objects

In this section, we added two files:

- arrays.ts
- tuples.ts

## Part 1

We looked at Typescript and arrays, including:

- Inference in arrays
- Annotations for initializing empty arrays
- Help with map, forEach, and reduce
- Arrays with multiple types

## Part 2

We looked at tuples, including

- When to use them (hint: not very often)
- How to annotate a tuple to avoid breaking structure
- Creating types for tuples
